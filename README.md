## About this

I am looking into VueJS. This is an ongoing experiment. I am using many nice features:

-   Typescript
-   Veutify
-   Vuex (global state like Redux)
-   Scss
-   Hot reloading

## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn run build
```

### Run your tests

```
yarn run test
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
yarn run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
